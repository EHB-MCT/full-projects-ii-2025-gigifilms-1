# GIGI Films - GIGI Casting

GIGI Films is founded by Zohra Benhammou and Romy Vanderveken, two filmmakers with roots in Brussels. With their website, they aim to showcase their work and create a platform for emerging acting talent.

Through the GIGI Casting platform, candidates can sign up for casting calls and are automatically added to a database. Directors get a clear overview of profiles and selected candidates, while GIGI Films can easily manage their own casting calls.

Our concept is called “Brick by Brick” — a visual translation of GIGI’s approach: constructive, reliable, and authentic. The style is diverse and solid, with a nod to Brussels.

The website serves as a portfolio, working tool, and community space, built on the same values that define GIGI Films: offering opportunities, telling real stories, and growing together.

### Website characteristics:

Navigation and colors:
To clearly separate GIGI Films and GIGI Casting, we used light backgrounds for casting pages and light-dark contrast for film pages. This ensures easy navigation and avoids confusion.

We chose a palette of light, dark, and brick red — a nod to the “Brick by Brick” concept and GIGI’s grounded, authentic style.
